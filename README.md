A temporal series is a set of data points collected over time. To describe a temporal series, several characteristics can be considered: Trend, Seasonality, Cyclical, Irregularity, Autocorrelation, Stationarity, Distribution.
Time series data is a collection of observations obtained through repeated measurements over time. Plot the points on a graph, and one of your axes would always be time.
Time series metrics refer to a piece of data that is tracked at an increment in time. For instance, a metric could refer to how much inventory was sold in a store from one day to the next.
Time series data is everywhere, since time is a constituent of everything that is observable. As our world gets increasingly instrumented, sensors and systems are constantly emitting a relentless stream of time series data. Such data has numerous applications across various industries.
